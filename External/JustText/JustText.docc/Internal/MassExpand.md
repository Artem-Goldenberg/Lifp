# ``JTMassExpand``

Performs an enormous amount of expansions on it's arguments

## Overview

No, actually, everyting is built on **this** macro!
It just expands whatever arguments you give to it many many times
This is the engine of the all variadic macros, like ``JTForEach``, ``JTMap`` and maybe some more in the future
Without it, we wouldn't be able to easily simulate recursive macros
