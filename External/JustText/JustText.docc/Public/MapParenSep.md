# ``JTMapParenSep``

Maps arguments, putting unpacked separator in-between

And here is the map which works with the parenthesized `sep`,
for example the most common usage: `JTMapParenSep(Id, (,), arg1, arg2, ...)`

- Parameter sep: **must be** of the form: `(whatever)`, 
    where `whatever` is whatever separator you want
