        Ok, so this is so cool. I am actually going to show you, 
        step by step how you can use this library, step-by-step.
        
        Imagine you are gonna write a simple bytecode interpreter in C 
        (should not be too much of a stretch as this is 
        exactly something you might want to do in C).
        
        Normally bytecodes have a lot of different types and kinds of instructions.
        
        Obviously, they also have tons of other stuff, but we are only gonna focus on
        managing the instructions infrastructure in this tutorial.

    @Section(title: "Traditional approach") {
        @ContentAndMedia {
            First, we will try to do the bytecodes management the traditional way.

        @Steps {
            @Step {
                <#text#>
                
                @Image(source: <#file#>, alt: "<#accessible description#>")
            }
            
            @Step {
                <#text#>
                
                @Code(name: "<#display name#>", file: <#filename.swift#>)
            }
        }
    }
}
