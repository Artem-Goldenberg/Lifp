# ``JustText``
*After all, it's just a bunch of text*

This library adds comparatively small, but very useful macros for the C language.   

All you need to do to use it, is to clone the repository and add it's folder to you headers search paths. 
For now the library includes [`JustText.h`](JustText.h), [`Internal/Sequences.h`](Internal/Sequences.h) 
and [`Internal/Internal.h`](Internal/Internal.h) headers.

See current documentation (rough version) at [github pages](https://artem-goldenberg.github.io/documentation/justtext/)
